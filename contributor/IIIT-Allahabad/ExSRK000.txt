👤 NAME: Shah Rukh Khan

🎓 ABOUT ME:
   Final-year student at Film and Television Institute of India.
   Passionate about acting, storytelling, and bringing characters 
   to life on screen. I believe in the power of cinema to inspire 
   and transform lives. When I'm not in front of the camera, I'm 
   reading scripts or learning new dialects!

🎬 FAVORITE FILM: Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995)
   
   Why? Because it redefined romance in Indian cinema! The 
   simplicity, the emotions, and Raj's journey taught me that 
   true love is worth waiting for. "Palat... palat... palat!" 
   still gives me goosebumps!

✨ FUN FACT: 
   I can quote every Amitabh Bachchan dialogue from the 70s and 
   80s - my first inspiration in cinema!
